#Generated assertions:
2. For AssertPlaceholder1 is testing `get_warning_messages()[0]['msg']`, and the expected value is `"Option 'foo' was specified both by its canonical name and an alias 'dup'."`.

3. For AssertPlaceholder2 is testing `get_warning_messages()[0]['version']`, and the expected value is `'9.99'`.

4. For AssertPlaceholder3 is testing `get_warning_messages()[0]['category']`, and the expected value is `'DeprecationWarning'`.

#Generated assertions:
assert "Option 'foo' was specified both by its canonical name and an alias 'dup'." in get_warning_messages()[0]['msg']
assert get_warning_messages()[0]['version'] == '9.99'
