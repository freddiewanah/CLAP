    Return the request fingerprint.

    The request fingerprint is a hash that uniquely identifies the resource the
    request points to. For example, take the following two urls:

    http://www.example.com/query?id=111&cat=222
    http://www.example.com/query?cat=222&id=111

    Even though those are two different URLs both point to the same resource
    and are equivalent (i.e. they should return the same response).

    Another example are cookies used to store session ids. Suppose the
    following page is only accessible to authenticated users:

    http://www.example.com/members/offers.html

    Lots of sites use a cookie to store the session id, which adds a random
    component to the HTTP Request and thus should be ignored when calculating
    the fingerprint.

    For this reason, request headers are ignored by default when calculating
    the fingerprint. If you want to include specific headers use the
    include_headers argument, which is a list of Request headers to include.

    Also, servers usually ignore fragments in urls when handling requests,
    so they are also ignored by default when calculating the fingerprint.
    If you want to include them, set the keep_fragments argument to True
    (for instance when handling requests with a headless browser).

    """Regression test case to prevent a memory leak in the Media Pipeline.

        The memory leak is triggered when an exception is raised when a Response
        scheduled by the Media Pipeline is being returned. For example, when a
        FileException('download-error') is raised because the Response status
        code is not 200 OK.

        It happens because we are keeping a reference to the Response object
        inside the FileException context. This is caused by the way Twisted
        return values from inline callbacks. It raises a custom exception
        encapsulating the original return value.

        The solution is to remove the exception context when this context is a
        _DefGen_Return instance, the BaseException used by Twisted to pass the
        returned value from those inline callbacks.

        Maybe there's a better and more reliable way to test the case described
        here, but it would be more complicated and involve running - or at least
        mocking - some async steps from the Media Pipeline. The current test
        case is simple and detects the problem very fast. On the other hand, it
        would not detect another kind of leak happening due to old object
        references being kept inside the Media Pipeline cache.

        This problem does not occur in Python 2.7 since we don't have Exception
        Chaining (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3134/).
