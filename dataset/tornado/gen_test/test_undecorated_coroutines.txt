def fetch(self, path: str, raise_error: bool=False, **kwargs: Any) -> HTTPResponse:
    """Convenience method to synchronously fetch a URL.

        The given path will be appended to the local server's host and
        port.  Any additional keyword arguments will be passed directly to
        `.AsyncHTTPClient.fetch` (and so could be used to pass
        ``method="POST"``, ``body="..."``, etc).

        If the path begins with http:// or https://, it will be treated as a
        full URL and will be fetched as-is.

        If ``raise_error`` is ``True``, a `tornado.httpclient.HTTPError` will
        be raised if the response code is not 200. This is the same behavior
        as the ``raise_error`` argument to `.AsyncHTTPClient.fetch`, but
        the default is ``False`` here (it's ``True`` in `.AsyncHTTPClient`)
        because tests often need to deal with non-200 response codes.

        .. versionchanged:: 5.0
           Added support for absolute URLs.

        .. versionchanged:: 5.1

           Added the ``raise_error`` argument.

        .. deprecated:: 5.1

           This method currently turns any exception into an
           `.HTTPResponse` with status code 599. In Tornado 6.0,
           errors other than `tornado.httpclient.HTTPError` will be
           passed through, and ``raise_error=False`` will only
           suppress errors that would be raised due to non-200
           response codes.
