    """Takes a list of list of constraints in tensor form (a list of
    tensor constraints for each sentence) and transforms it into a
    packed Tensor. For example, here is a batch of size 3 with 3, 0,
    and 1 constraints:

        [ [ [3 1 2], [3], [4 5 6 7], ]
          [],
          [ [1 8 9 10 1 4 11 12], ]

    Its corresponding packed structure is:

        [ [ 3  3  1  2  0  3  0  4  5  6  7  0],
          [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0],
          [ 1  1  8  9 10  1  4 11 12  0  0  0] ]

    The packed tensor has shape (batch size, maxlen), where
    maxlen is defined below. Each row contains concatenated
    constraint tokens for that sentence, with 0 appended after
    each constraint. The first item in each row is the number
    of constraints for that sentence. So maxlen is the maximum
    of

    (number of constraints) + (sum length of constraints) + 1.

    across all sentences in the batch.
